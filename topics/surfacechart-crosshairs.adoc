== Configuring Crosshairs Visibility

=== Overview

Crosshairs appears as a set of thin lines on mouse hover over the  _xamScatterSurface3D_   series surface. They intersect at the mouse pointer and help the user to locate precisely a data point of interest.

Use the link:{SurfaceChartLink}.xamscattersurface3d_members.html[XamScatterSurface3D] link:{SurfaceChartLink}.xamchart3d~crosshairaxes.html[CrosshairAxes] property to configure for which axes the crosshairs are visible.

By default, the crosshairs are enabled for all axes and the initial value of the `CrosshairAxes` is `AxisFlags3D.XYZ`.

=== Property settings

The following table maps the desired configuration to the property settings that manage it.

|In order to:|Use this property:|And set it to:

|Configure the crosshairs visibility for specific axes
| link:{SurfaceChartLink}.xamchart3d~crosshairaxes.html[CrosshairAxes]
| link:{SurfaceChartLink}.axisflags3d.html[AxisFlags3D]

|====

=== Example

The screenshot below demonstrates how the  _xamScatterSurface3D_   control crosshairs behave as a result of the following settings:

[options="header", cols="a,a"]
|====
|Property|Value

| link:{SurfaceChartLink}.xamchart3d~crosshairaxes.html[CrosshairAxes]
| _XY_ 

|====

Following is the code that implements this example.

*In XAML:*

[source,xaml]
----
<ig:XamScatterSurface3D Name="SurfaceChart" 
 ItemsSource="{Binding Path=DataCollection}" 
 XMemberPath="X" YMemberPath="Y" ZMemberPath="Z" 
 CrosshairAxes="XY" />
----

*In C#:*

[source,csharp]
----
…
SurfaceChart.CrosshairAxes = AxisFlags3D.XY;
----

*In Visual Basic:*

[source,vb]
----
…
SurfaceChart.CrosshairAxes = AxisFlags3D.XY

== Configuring Crosshair Brush

=== Overview

Use the link:{SurfaceChartLink}.xamscattersurface3d_members.html[XamScatterSurface3D] link:{SurfaceChartLink}.xamchart3d~crosshairbrush.html[CrosshairBrush] property to configure the crosshair brush.

=== Property settings
