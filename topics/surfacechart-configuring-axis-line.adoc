== Configuring Axis Line Stroke

=== Overview

Use the link:{SurfaceChartLink}.surfacechartaxis.html[SurfaceChartAxis] link:{SurfaceChartLink}.surfacechartaxis~stroke.html[Stroke] property to configure the axis line stroke in the  _xamScatterSurface3D_   control.

=== Property settings

The following table maps the desired configuration to the property settings that manage it.

[options="header", cols="a,a,a"]
|====
|In order to:|Use this property:|And set it to:

|Configure the axis line brush
| link:{SurfaceChartLink}.surfacechartaxis~stroke.html[Stroke]
|`Brush`

|====

=== Example

The screenshot below demonstrates how the axis line looks as a result of the following settings:

[options="header", cols="a,a"]
|====
|Property|Value

| link:{SurfaceChartLink}.surfacechartaxis~stroke.html[Stroke]
| _Green_ 

|====

Following is the code that implements this example.

*In XAML:*

[source,xaml]
----
<ig:XamScatterSurface3D Name="SurfaceChart" 
 ItemsSource="{Binding Path=DataCollection}" 
 XMemberPath="X" YMemberPath="Y" ZMemberPath="Z" 
 FloorMaterial="{x:Null}" ShowFloorProjection=">
    <ig:XamScatterSurface3D.XAxis>
       <ig:LinearAxis Stroke="Green" />
    </ig:XamScatterSurface3D.XAxis>
</ig:XamScatterSurface3D>
----

*In C#:*

[source,csharp]
----
…
var linearAxis = new LinearAxis();
linearAxis.Stroke = new SolidColorBrush(Colors.Green);
SurfaceChart.XAxis = linearAxis;
----

*In Visual Basic:*

[source,vb]
----
…
Dim linearAxis = New LinearAxis()
linearAxis.Stroke = New SolidColorBrush(Colors.Green)
SurfaceChart.XAxis = linearAxis
----

== Configuring Axis Line Stroke Thickness

=== Overview

Use the link:{SurfaceChartLink}.surfacechartaxis.html[SurfaceChartAxis] link:{SurfaceChartLink}.surfacechartaxis~strokethickness.html[StrokeThickness] property to configure the axis line stroke thickness in the  _xamScatterSurface3D_   control.

=== Property settings

The following table maps the desired configuration to the property settings that manage it.

[options="header", cols="a,a,a"]
|====
|In order to:|Use this property:|And set it to:

|Configure the axis line thickness
| link:{SurfaceChartLink}.surfacechartaxis~strokethickness.html[StrokeThickness]
|`double`

|====

=== Example

The screenshot below demonstrates how the axis line looks as a result of the following settings:

[options="header", cols="a,a"]
|====
|Property|Value

| link:{SurfaceChartLink}.surfacechartaxis~strokethickness.html[StrokeThickness]
| _3_
