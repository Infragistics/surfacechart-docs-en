== Configuring Chart Scale

=== Overview

Use the link:{SurfaceChartLink}.xamscattersurface3d_members.html[XamScatterSurface3D] link:{SurfaceChartLink}.xamchart3d~scale.html[Scale] property to configure the scale of the  _xamScatterSurface3D_   control.

By default, the initial value of the `Scale` is 0.8.

=== Property settings

The following table maps the desired configuration to the property settings that manage it.

Following is the code that implements this example.

*In XAML:*

[source,xaml]
----
<ig:XamScatterSurface3D Name="SurfaceChart3" 
 ItemsSource="{Binding Path=DataCollection}" 
 XMemberPath="X" YMemberPath="Y" ZMemberPath="Z" 
 Scale="0.5"/>
----

*In C#:*

[source,csharp]
----
…
SurfaceChart.Scale = 0.5;
----

*In Visual Basic:*

[source,vb]
----
…
SurfaceChart.Scale = 0.5
