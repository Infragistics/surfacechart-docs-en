== Configuring Axis Label Visibility Settings

=== Overview

Use the link:{SurfaceChartLink}.surfacechartaxis.html[SurfaceChartAxis] link:{SurfaceChartLink}.surfacechartaxis~labelopacity.html[LabelOpacity] and link:{SurfaceChartLink}.surfacechartaxis~labelvisibility.html[LabelVisibility] properties to configure the label text opacity and the label visibility.

By default, the axes labels are visible.

=== Property settings

The following table maps the desired configuration to the property settings that manage it.

[options="header", cols="a,a,a"]

|In order to:|Use this property:|And set it to:

|Configure the axis label text opacity
| link:{SurfaceChartLink}.surfacechartaxis~labelopacity.html[LabelOpacity]
|`double`

|Configure the axis label visibility
| link:{SurfaceChartLink}.surfacechartaxis~labelvisibility.html[LabelVisibility]
|`Visibility`

=== Example

The screenshot below demonstrates how the axis label looks as a result of the following settings:

Following is the code that implements this example.

*In XAML:*

[source,xaml]
----
<ig:XamScatterSurface3D Name="SurfaceChart" 
 ItemsSource="{Binding Path=DataCollection}" 
 XMemberPath="X" YMemberPath="Y" ZMemberPath="Z" >
    <ig:XamScatterSurface3D.XAxis>
        <ig:LinearAxis LabelOpacity="0.5" />
    </ig:XamScatterSurface3D.XAxis>
</ig:XamScatterSurface3D>
----

*In C#:*

[source,csharp]
----
…
var linearAxis = new LinearAxis();
linearAxis.LabelOpacity = 0.5;
SurfaceChart.XAxis = linearAxis;
----

*In Visual Basic:*

[source,vb]
----
…
Dim linearAxis = New LinearAxis()
linearAxis.LabelOpacity = 0.5
SurfaceChart.XAxis = linearAxis
