== Configuring Light Direction

=== Overview

Use the link:{SurfaceChartLink}.xamscattersurface3d_members.html[XamScatterSurface3D] link:{SurfaceChartLink}.xamchart3d~lightdirection.html[LightDirection] property to specify the direction of the light that lights up the  _xamScatterSurface3D_   control.

=== Property settings

The following table maps the desired configuration to the property settings that manage it.

[options="header", cols="a,a,a"]
|====
|In order to:|Use this property:|And set it to:

|Specify the light direction
| link:{SurfaceChartLink}.xamchart3d~lightdirection.html[LightDirection]
|`Vector3D`

|====

=== Example

The screenshot below demonstrates how the  _xamScatterSurface3D_   control looks as a result of the following settings:

[options="header", cols="a,a"]
|====
|Property|Value

| link:{SurfaceChartLink}.xamchart3d~lightdirection.html[LightDirection]
| _0 -1 0_ 

|====

Following is the code that implements this example.

*In XAML:*

[source,xaml]
----
<ig:XamScatterSurface3D Name="SurfaceChart" 
 ItemsSource="{Binding Path=DataCollection}" 
 XMemberPath="X" YMemberPath="Y" ZMemberPath="Z" 
 LightDirection="0 -1 0" />
----

*In C#:*

[source,csharp]
----
SurfaceChart.LightDirection = new System.Windows.Media.Media3D.Vector3D(0, -1, 0);
----

*In Visual Basic:*

[source,vb]
----
SurfaceChart.LightDirection = New System.Windows.Media.Media3D.Vector3D(0, -1, 0)
----
