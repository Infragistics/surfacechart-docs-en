 XMemberPath="X" YMemberPath="Y" ZMemberPath="Z" >
    <ig:XamScatterSurface3D.XAxis>
        <ig:LinearAxis Title="X Axis" 
 TitleOpacity="0.5" />
    </ig:XamScatterSurface3D.XAxis>
</ig:XamScatterSurface3D>
----

*In C#:*

[source,csharp]
----
var linearAxis = new LinearAxis();
linearAxis.Title = "X Axis";
linearAxis.TitleOpacity = 0.5;
SurfaceChart.XAxis = linearAxis;
