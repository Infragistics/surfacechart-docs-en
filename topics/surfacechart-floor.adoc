== Configuring Floor Material

=== Overview

Use the link:{SurfaceChartLink}.xamscattersurface3d_members.html[XamScatterSurface3D] link:{SurfaceChartLink}.xamscattersurface3d~floormaterial.html[FloorMaterial] property to configure the material of the floor.

By default, the `FloorMaterial` is bound to the link:{SurfaceChartLink}.xamscattersurface3d~actualseriesmaterial.html[ActualSeriesMaterial] property which is a composite of the link:{SurfaceChartLink}.xamscattersurface3d~seriesmaterial.html[SeriesMaterial] (or link:{SurfaceChartLink}.xamscattersurface3d~seriescolors.html[SeriesColors] when the `SeriesMaterial` is null), along with some default materials applied by the  _xamScatterSurface3D_   control.

=== Property settings

The following table maps the desired configuration to the property settings that manage it.

|Configure the floor material
| link:{SurfaceChartLink}.xamscattersurface3d~floormaterial.html[FloorMaterial]
|`Material`

=== Example

The screenshot below demonstrates how the  _xamScatterSurface3D_   control floor looks as a result of the following settings:

== Configuring Floor Projection

=== Overview

Use the link:{SurfaceChartLink}.xamscattersurface3d_members.html[XamScatterSurface3D] link:{SurfaceChartLink}.xamscattersurface3d~showfloorprojection.html[ShowFloorProjection] property to enable/disable the projection of the series on the floor of the  _xamScatterSurface3D_   control.

By default, the projection is enabled and the value of this property is `True`.

=== Property settings

The following table maps the desired configuration to the property settings that manage it.

[options="header", cols="a,a,a"]
|====
|In order to:|Use this property:|And set it to:

|Enable/disable the series projection on the floor
| link:{SurfaceChartLink}.xamscattersurface3d~showfloorprojection.html[ShowFloorProjection]
|`True/False`

|====

=== Example

The screenshots below demonstrate how the  _xamScatterSurface3D_   control floor looks with enabled and disabled projection:

 XMemberPath="X" YMemberPath="Y" ZMemberPath="Z" 
 ShowFloorProjection=" />
----

*In C#:*

…
SurfaceChart.ShowFloorProjection = false;
