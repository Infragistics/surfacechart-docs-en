== Configuring Aspect

=== Overview

Use the link:{SurfaceChartLink}.xamscattersurface3d_members.html[XamScatterSurface3D] link:{SurfaceChartLink}.xamchart3d~aspect.html[Aspect] property to configure the aspect of the  _xamScatterSurface3D_   control.

=== Property settings

The following table maps the desired configuration to the property settings that manage it.

|Configure the aspect of the _xamScatterSurface3D_ control
| link:{SurfaceChartLink}.xamchart3d~aspect.html[Aspect]
|`Vector3D`

|====

=== Example

The screenshot below demonstrates how the  _xamScatterSurface3D_   looks as a result of the following code:

image::images/Aspect_and_Perspective_1.png[]

Following is the code that implements this example.

*In XAML:*

[source,xaml]
----
<ig:XamScatterSurface3D Name="SurfaceChart" 
 ItemsSource="{Binding Path=DataCollection}" 
 XMemberPath="X" YMemberPath="Y" ZMemberPath="Z" 
 Aspect="1 1 0.5" />
----

Following is the code that implements this example in C#.

*In C#:*

[source,csharp]
----
SurfaceChart.Aspect = new System.Windows.Media.Media3D.Vector3D(1, 1, 0.5);
----

Following is the code that implements this example in VB.

*In Visual Basic:*

[source,vb]
----
SurfaceChart.Aspect = New System.Windows.Media.Media3D.Vector3D(1, 1, 0.5)
----

== Configuring Perspective

=== Overview

Use the link:{SurfaceChartLink}.xamscattersurface3d_members.html[XamScatterSurface3D] link:{SurfaceChartLink}.xamchart3d~perspective.html[Perspective] property to configure the perspective of the  _xamScatterSurface3D_   control.

By default, the initial value of the `Perspective` property is 0.5.

=== Property settings

The following table maps the desired configuration to the property settings that manage it.

=== Example

The screenshot below demonstrates how the  _xamScatterSurface3D_   looks as a result of the following code:

image::images/Aspect_and_Perspective_2.png[]

Following is the code that implements this example.

*In XAML:*

[source,xaml]
----
<ig:XamScatterSurface3D Name="SurfaceChart" ItemsSource="{Binding Path=DataCollection}" XMemberPath="X" YMemberPath="Y" ZMemberPath="Z" Perspective="1"/>
----

Following is the code that implements this example.

*In C#:*

[source,csharp]
----
SurfaceChart.Perspective = 1;
----

Following is the code that implements this example.

*In Visual Basic:*

[source,vb]
----
SurfaceChart.Perspective = 1
