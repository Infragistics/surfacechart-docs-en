== Configuring Grid Lines Stroke

=== Overview

Use the link:{SurfaceChartLink}.surfacechartaxis_members.html[SurfaceChartAxis] link:{SurfaceChartLink}.surfacechartaxis~gridstroke.html[GridStroke] property to configure the grid lines stroke in the  _xamScatterSurface3D_   control.

=== Property settings

The following table maps the desired configuration to the property settings that manage it.

[options="header", cols="a,a,a"]
|====
|In order to:|Use this property:|And set it to:

|Configure the grid lines brush
| link:{SurfaceChartLink}.surfacechartaxis~gridstroke.html[GridStroke]
|`Brush`

|====

=== Example

The screenshot below demonstrates how the grid lines look as a result of the following settings:

[options="header", cols="a,a"]
|====
|Property|Value

| link:{SurfaceChartLink}.surfacechartaxis~gridstroke.html[GridStroke]
| _Orange_

Following is the code that implements this example.

*In XAML:*

[source,xaml]
----
<ig:XamScatterSurface3D Name="SurfaceChart" 
 ItemsSource="{Binding Path=DataCollection}" 
 XMemberPath="X" YMemberPath="Y" ZMemberPath="Z"                                    
 ShowFloorProjection=" FloorMaterial="{x:Null}">
    <ig:XamScatterSurface3D.XAxis>
        <ig:LinearAxis GridStroke="Orange" />
    </ig:XamScatterSurface3D.XAxis>
</ig:XamScatterSurface3D>
----

*In C#:*

[source,csharp]
----
…
var linearAxis = new LinearAxis();
linearAxis.GridStroke = new SolidColorBrush(Colors.Orange);
SurfaceChart.XAxis = linearAxis;
----

*In Visual Basic:*

[source,vb]
