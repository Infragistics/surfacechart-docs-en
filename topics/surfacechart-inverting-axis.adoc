== Inverting Axis

=== Overview

Use the link:{SurfaceChartLink}.surfacechartaxis.html[SurfaceChartAxis] link:{SurfaceChartLink}.surfacechartaxis~isinverted.html[IsInverted] property to invert the specific axis in the  _xamScatterSurface3D_   control.

=== Property settings

The following table maps the desired configuration to the property settings that manage it.

Following is the code that implements this example.

*In XAML:*

[source,xaml]
----
<ig:XamScatterSurface3D Name="SurfaceChart" 
    ItemsSource="{Binding Path=DataCollection}" 
    XMemberPath="X" YMemberPath="Y" ZMemberPath="Z">
    <ig:XamScatterSurface3D.ZAxis>
        <ig:LinearAxis Title="Z Axis" IsInverted="True" />
    </ig:XamScatterSurface3D.ZAxis>
</ig:XamScatterSurface3D>
----

*In C#:*

[source,csharp]
----
…
var linearAxis = new LinearAxis();
linearAxis.Title = "Z Axis";
linearAxis.IsInverted = true;
SurfaceChart.ZAxis = linearAxis;
----

*In Visual Basic:*

[source,vb]
----
…
Dim linearAxis = New LinearAxis()
linearAxis.Title = "Z Axis"
linearAxis.IsInverted = True
SurfaceChart.ZAxis = linearAxis
