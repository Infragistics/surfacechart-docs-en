== Configuring Rotation Specifying an Axis and Angle

=== Overview

Use the link:{SurfaceChartLink}.xamchart3d~rotation.html[Rotation] property to set rotation programmatically in the  _xamScatterSurface3D_   control.

Set the `Rotation` property to an `AxisAngleRotation3D` object with specified angle and axis of rotation.

=== Property settings

The following table maps the desired configuration to the property settings that manage it.

=== Example

The screenshot below demonstrates how the  _xamScatterSurface3D_   control looks as a result of the following settings – 60 degrees rotation around the Y axis:

Following is the code that implements this example.

*In XAML:*

[source,xaml]
----
<ig:XamScatterSurface3D Name="SurfaceChart" 
 ItemsSource="{Binding Path=DataCollection}" 
 XMemberPath="X" YMemberPath="Y" ZMemberPath="Z">
    <ig:XamScatterSurface3D.Rotation>
        <AxisAngleRotation3D Angle="60" Axis="0 1 0" />
    </ig:XamScatterSurface3D.Rotation>
</ig:XamScatterSurface3D>
----

*In C#:*

[source,csharp]
----
var axis = new Vector3D(0, 1, 0);
var axisAngleRotation3D = new AxisAngleRotation3D(axis, 60);
SurfaceChart.Rotation = axisAngleRotation3D;
----

*In Visual Basic:*

[source,vb]
----
Dim axis = New Vector3D(0, 1, 0)
Dim axisAngleRotation3D = New AxisAngleRotation3D(axis, 60)
SurfaceChart.Rotation = axisAngleRotation3D

== Configuring Rotation using Quaternion

=== Overview

Use the link:{SurfaceChartLink}.xamchart3d~rotation.html[Rotation] property to set rotation programmatically in the  _xamScatterSurface3D_   control.

Set the `Rotation` property to a `QuaternionRotation3D` object that represents a rotation transformation defined as a quaternion.

If the rotation axes are named ax, ay and az and the angle of rotation is named theta, you can calculate the quaternion using the following formula:

The quaternion (x, y, z, w) is:

x = ax $$*$$ sin(theta/2)

y = ay $$*$$ sin(theta/2)

z = az $$*$$ sin(theta/2)

w = cos(theta/2)

So if you want to rotate the  _xamScatterSurface3D_   control around the Y axis and with angle of 60 degrees as the example above, the quaternion will be equal to (0, 0.5, 0, 0.866).

var quaternionRotation3D = new QuaternionRotation3D();
quaternionRotation3D.Quaternion = quaternion;
SurfaceChart.Rotation = quaternionRotation3D;

Dim quaternion = New Quaternion()
quaternion.X = 0

quaternion.Z = 0
quaternion.W = 0.866
Dim quaternionRotation3D = New QuaternionRotation3D()
quaternionRotation3D.Quaternion = quaternion
SurfaceChart.Rotation = quaternionRotation3D
