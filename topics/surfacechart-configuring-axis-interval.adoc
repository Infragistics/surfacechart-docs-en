== Configuring Axis Interval

=== Overview

Use the link:{SurfaceChartLink}.linearaxis.html[LinearAxis] link:{SurfaceChartLink}.linearaxis~interval.html[Interval] property to configure the axis interval in the  _xamScatterSurface3D_   control.

The `Interval` property manages the frequency of the grid lines.

By default, the axes intervals are automatically calculated based on the axes minimum and maximum values.

=== Property settings

The following table maps the desired configuration to the property settings that manage it.

Following is the code that implements this example.

*In XAML:*

[source,xaml]
----
<ig:XamScatterSurface3D Name="SurfaceChart" 
 ItemsSource="{Binding Path=DataCollection}" 
 XMemberPath="X" YMemberPath="Y" ZMemberPath="Z">
    <ig:XamScatterSurface3D.XAxis>
        <ig:LinearAxis Interval="2"/>
    </ig:XamScatterSurface3D.XAxis>
</ig:XamScatterSurface3D>
----

Following is the code that implements this example in C#.

*In C#:*

[source,csharp]
----
…
var linearAxis = new LinearAxis();
linearAxis.Interval = 2;
SurfaceChart.XAxis = linearAxis;
----

Following is the code that implements this example.

*In Visual Basic:*

[source,vb]
----
…
Dim linearAxis = New LinearAxis()
linearAxis.Interval = 2
SurfaceChart.XAxis = linearAxis
