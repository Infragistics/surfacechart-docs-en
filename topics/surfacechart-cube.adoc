== Configuring Cube Material

=== Overview

Use the link:{SurfaceChartLink}.xamscattersurface3d_members.html[XamScatterSurface3D] link:{SurfaceChartLink}.xamchart3d~cubematerial.html[CubeMaterial] property to configure the material of the  _xamScatterSurface3D_   control background cube.

=== Property settings

The following table maps the desired configuration to the property settings that manage it.

== Configuring Cube Rim Thickness

=== Overview

Use the link:{SurfaceChartLink}.xamscattersurface3d_members.html[XamScatterSurface3D] link:{SurfaceChartLink}.xamchart3d~rimthickness.html[RimThickness] property to configure the thickness of the cube rim of the  _xamScatterSurface3D_   control.

This property value is a value between 0 and 1, relative to the size of the entire cube.

=== Property settings

The following table maps the desired configuration to the property settings that manage it.

|In order to:|Use this property:|And set it to:

|Configure the cube rim thickness
| link:{SurfaceChartLink}.xamchart3d~rimthickness.html[RimThickness]
|`double`
